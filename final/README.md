Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.


1. Before this class i didn't know anything about using git hub, or repositories. I started from scratch in the web development
department and im really pleased with how much ive learned in that area. I'm hoping the website will still be up in the
coming months so i can revisit setting up repositories and linking to the desktop application and everything.
2. Absolutely, setting up css stylesheets and properties and attributes was all for the most part new. Again, I feel like i learned
a TON in a short amount of time.
3. I feel like this whole class was a challenge, rarely did things happen right the first time. It's a big puzzle, and a lot
of trial and error. I think taking that attitude, that it's all just a big puzzle and if i consider it logically i can work it out was helpful in
overcoming challenges in this class.
