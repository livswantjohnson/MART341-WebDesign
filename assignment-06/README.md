1. A page can only have one head and one body. The information in the head isn't displayed on a webpage, they just are information used by the browser. The body contains information that is processed by the browser and displayed.

 2. Structural markup defines the structure of a document, like body, paragraph, and line breaks. Semantic markup changes the way that text is displayed, like in bold, or italics.

 3. My work cycle for this was the same as usual- I went through the module on the course website before i opened the homework. I referenced the website a few times while I was doing the homework in atom and I saved periodically using my desktop github and checked to make sure that the live site was right.
