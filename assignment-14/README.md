1. I used foundation, I also used the uikit - sort of? I'm not really sure.
2. Ok, im really confused- I didn't see the term CDN once in the reading or in the homework, i dont know what that means. I downloaded the foundation and uikit css files and put them in my assignemtn 14 file and then linked to it. im not sure if that's what you're asking but i didn't know there was another option, i just sort of stumbled my way into that option and im not sure i did it right. I feel like i missed something, also about javascript or how these coordinates work
3. HTML5 introduces a larger set of technologies for web design and allows for more powerful web design and a new language with more of a vocabulary for browsers to understand i guess?
4. This week I really feel like im missing something- i only sort of understand using javascript here or even what javascript is doing. I thiiiink that javascript is identifying individual coordinates and thats how at some point ill be able to tell an element to move onto the screen and at a specific spot but i don't really understand how the language of it works or any of the var or c stuff. I googled a javascript code generator thing that would allow me to draw and then give me the code for the shape, and fiddled around with that for awhile until i could get that to work. I wasn't able to figure out how to make the drawImage thing work, though, and i couldnt figure out how to actually make art with it.
