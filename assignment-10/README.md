1. universal is noted with a * and it applies the declaration to every element on the page universally. Element selectors would be like .h1 or .p and it applies the declarations to every h1 or p on a page or site regardless of if they are in different classes. classes include a group of elements within a div, so you could put a background behind an image, text and heading for example. Lasly and id is just one individual div, or group of elements.
2. I used a hex color picker online and just uploaded the background image that i chose, so my colors are #e23000 , #002947, and rgb(250,237,203,0.7). originally all of my colors were in hex but i just learned that with rgb you can adjust opacity directly within the color and so ill probably start using rgb from now on unless you've got a reason that i shouldnt?
3.i had to do a little googling but i figured out how to align images and text and how to adjust the opacity of individual colors for backgrounds. How would i go about making the background color the paragraph only extend to the edges of the text and not the width of the page?
