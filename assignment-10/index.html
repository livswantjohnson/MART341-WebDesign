     <h1>The Era of the Flower Child</h1>
     <p>The 70s were an era in which bell bottoms and free love reigned supreme,<br>
  Jimi Hendrix, Joe Cocker and Jerry Garcia sang sweet ballads and slapped <br>
  basses or something. I picture veganism and body odor masked with patchouli, <br>
  Hippies selling tabs of acid for a dollar in Golden Gate <br>
 park, wearing black armbands and no shirt. Janice Joplin was an incredible yeller.<br>
