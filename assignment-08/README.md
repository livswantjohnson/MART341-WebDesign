1. divs are a way to group or contain information, images, videos,
maps, audio, etc. They are a block element so they meet the edges of the site.
Spans are an inline div and group things within a single line without creating a space
all of the way to the borders of the page. I'm still a little fuzzy on the times when you
would use span, but I'm beginning to get it. Ids are unique identifiers specific to
individual elements on a page. They're one way a css can identify which elements to apply
a style to. classes group elements together for a css to apply styles more broadly. while an element can only have one id, it can have multiple classes, like how a person has one identity but can belong to multiple groups.
2.Using a service like youtube or vimeo is nice when using a service like github which doesnt support files as large as most videos, so the videos can be stored on a different server which does and then linked to the page using an iframe tag. It may take longer to load than the rest of the page, and wont work in the event that vimeo or youtubes servers go down.
3. This week went pretty smoothly. I did the reading before the homework and only needed to go back to them a few times to double check how to do something.
