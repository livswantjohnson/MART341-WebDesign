  <h1>How to Pop Shuvit</h1>
  <img src="./images/pop-shuvit.jpeg" alt="a kid on a skateboard does a pop shuvit">
  <h2>What you'll Need</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Skateboard</li>
    <li>Skate Shoes *optional*</li>
    <li>Ankle Brace *also optional*</li>
    <li>Some concrete or other flat surface</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Action!</h2>
  <pre>Stand on your skateboard with your back foot on the tail and your front
  foot just behind the screws. Be sure that both feet are parallel to each other
  and perpendicular to the board and keep your shoulders square to your feet, like
  any other trick.

  Now, push the tail down with your back foot, like a button, quickly
  so that the tail hits the ground and pops back up.

  While bending your knees so that the board can come up, kick the board behind
  you with your back foot, and keep contact with the board with your front foot.

  The board should spin 180 degrees, and you should stomp the board back onto the
  ground with both feet in the same position they started, at the same time.

  And that's a pop shuvit!
