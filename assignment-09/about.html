     I chose to do the pop shuvit because it's the only consistent skate trick
    I've got at the moment, and it's decently easy to explain. It's pretty fun and
    and a great place to start if you're just getting into skating flat. For more
    resources on skating and skate tricks, I recommend going to the skatepark.
    Everyone and their mother will give you pointers, this is especially true
    if you are a woman.

    For further reference, here's this video:
