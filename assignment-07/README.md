1. Forms seem to serve lots of purposes! They allow you to log in, subscribe to email lists,
search for things within a site or on a search engine, take questionaires and quizzes, post to social media,
fill out legal documents, sign up for appointments, etc.  

2. A text input would be used to allow users to enter an email, it would appear as a text box and
could be styled using a size and maximum length attribute, it could also include a text prompt within it,
like facebooks "whats on your mind?" or whatever it says inside their status bar which I assume was coded for
using a placeholder.
A selection input generally appears as a label with a bubble next to it, and allows the user to select one
or more options.
A button input could allow users to submit, upload or be redirected.

3. I struggled a little more on this one. I didn't spend as much time doing the reading initially and did it more
alongside the homework assignment, which i don't think was the best way of doing it, but I did get it done and i
think i understand everything. I was most confused about the methods with labeling, and with the differences between
name and id. Also, I couldn't get a border around my table.
