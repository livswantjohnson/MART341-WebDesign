system fonts are the fonts already on your computer, web fonts are fonts hosted on the internet that can either be downloaded or embedded into a site. I'm still working on understanding this.
Fallback fonts are a back up in case a web browser is unable to read the primary font.
Challenges were mostly just still getting used to css and linking between stylesheets and selectors and stuff. the css diner thing was really helpful
