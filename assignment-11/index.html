        Matilda is the world's most famous bookworm, no thanks to her <i>ghastly</i> parents.<br>
      Her father thinks she's a little scab. Her mother spends all afternoon playing bingo.<br>
      And her headmistress, Miss Trunchbull? She's the worst of all.<br>

        By the time she was three, Matilda had taught herself to read by studying newspapers <br>
      and magazines that lay around the house. At the age of four, she could read fast and <br>
      well and she naturally began hankering after books. The only book in the whole of this <br>
      enlightened household was something called Easy Cooking belonging to her mother, and <br>
      when she had read this from cover to cover and had learnt all the recipes by heart, <br>
      she decided she wanted something more interesting.</p>
