      <h1>Matilda</h1>
    <h2>Roald Dahl</h2>
    <pre>
        Matilda is the world's most famous bookworm, no thanks to her ghastly parents.
      Her father thinks she's a little scab. Her mother spends all afternoon playing bingo.
      And her headmistress, Miss Trunchbull? She's the worst of all.

        By the time she was three, Matilda had taught herself to read by studying newspapers
      and magazines that lay around the house. At the age of four, she could read fast and
      well and she naturally began hankering after books. The only book in the whole of this
      enlightened household was something called Easy Cooking belonging to her mother, and
      when she had read this from cover to cover and had learnt all the recipes by heart,
      she decided she wanted something more interesting.</pre>
