    <h1>Jack and the Beanstalk</h1>
    <h2> Old English Fairy Tale <h2>
    <hr />
<pre>
      My dad used ot tell me this story. I think it's the only one he knows,
  and he told it in roughly the same way every time.
      It's a story about a boy named Jack. Him and his mother are very poor,
  and she tells him to go to the market and sell their milk cow, it's all
  they have left.
      When Jack returns with some <i>magic beans</i> instead of any money, she
  is understandably angry, throws the beans out the window and sends Jack to
  bed without dinner. The next day however, a massive beanstalk, many stories
  high has grown outside of the window.
    Jack climbs the beanstalk on numerous occasions to find  many treasures,
  including a golden harp and a goose that lays golden eggs.
      Unfortunately, an angry giant gaurdsthese treasures. Jack bravely
  makes many trips up the beanstalk, using various tactics to distract the
  giant, who always ends up chasing after him.
    At these points in the story, my dad would put on a deep, loud voice and
    chant
    <i>           FEE FI FO FUM
                  I SMELL THE BLOOD OF AN ENGLISH-MUN
                  IF HE'S ALIVE,
                  OR IF HE'S DEAD,
                  I'LL GRIND HIS BONES TO MAKE MY BREAD  </i>
