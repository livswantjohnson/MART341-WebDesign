1. So i started making my own website instead.. which i think really tripped me up a lot because i spent a lot of time just going through images and getting distracted. The needs for my website are a gallery, a contact page, about page with a list of services and then . I actually have put a lot of thought into my webstie but i still am not entirely sure how it should be set up, so i just went with your directions for now.
2. because most people view everything on mobile devices - 51% of people only view the internet from their phone.
3. I struggled with pretty much everything this week. I apologize for how poorly this is done, my brain is mush. I spent about an hour just trying to figure out how to make a background image work properly, which it still isnt doing. I'm also really confused about relatvie sizes for elements and images as well as z-indexing and proper positioning. I thought i had figured it out last week, but now I'm not sure. I tweaked things for awhile. I'm really sorry for how poorly ive done this- i had to prioritze other classes this week and my work this week is reflective of that. I really want to make it better, but my brain is shuttin down.
