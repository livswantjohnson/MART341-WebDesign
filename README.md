# Olivia Swant-Johnson - MART341-WebDesign

This week we learned about file types and the basic structure of websites, we made a repository in github for our assignments and created a new assignemt. My assignment is named assignment-1 instead of assignment-2 and i can't change it now so my next assignemtn will have to be assignment-3 and skip 2 but other than that, I don't think I really struggled much.
