padding is the space between content and the edge of the box, the margin is the space between boxes, and the border is the border of the box.
I'm struggling to understand how to properly size pictures and elements, and relative sizes. I still only have a basic understanding of it, but if I thiiiink i can just use a percentage element sizes and then the element will be that percent of the width/height of the page, so if i want elements to sit inline they have to together equal 100% or less. I also wanted to play around with z-index, i made a couple of attempts and ran out of time for now.
